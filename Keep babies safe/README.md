<h1>Deep Learning Challenge - Hackerearth</h1>

<h3>Theme: Keep babies safe</h3>


<h4>Problem statement</h4>
Every new parent is sure to go leaps and bounds to provide a safe, caring, and nourishing home for their infant. With the advent of Baby Safety Month, a renowned multi-store hypermarket is all set to grow its business, by targeting new and expecting parents worldwide. As part of its expansion, the owner plans to introduce an exclusive section that will sell products for babies and toddlers. To optimise the inventory procurement process, teams across all stores were tasked to collate images of commonly used baby-products. 
Your task, as a Machine Learning expert, is to build a Deep Learning model that will tag each image with the extracted product types and brand names of these products. In case there is no brand name mentioned on a product, the model should tag the image as Unnamed.

<h4>Dataset</h4>
The dataset consists of 1500 images depicting numerous baby products - baby-proofing kits, toys, gadgets, and the like.
The benefits of practicing this problem by using unsupervised Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques are as follows:

1. To apply your unsupervised Deep Learning skills to build models that can extract, identify, and tag brand names of various products.
2. Image processing and optical character recognition (OCR) based brand name search

We challenge you to build a model that will tag images with corresponding brand names of baby/kid products.
